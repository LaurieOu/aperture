BUGS:


******* nested for loop to determine photos inclusion within a collection. (BAD)! Optimize later *******

Questions: CSS trick for the view collection page. How to prevent it from squishing horizontally? Is this possible without javascript?







TASKS FOR TOMORROW:

	BIG ITEMS:

		Fix routes so that i can use a hook route when calling photo detail page and can use escape/etc to go there.

		(Almost done) Add tag form to edit picture form

		Photo Upload form
			- add ability to remove added photos
			- have it automatically 'select' the first image

		Add Edit profile form

		Add Edit collection form

		Error Handling for Forms

		Create tag "items" that can be cancelled


		Create a guest account feature

		Make a splash page

		Infinite scroll

		Add ability to delete a comment




		finish up styling:
			- 'selected' images
			- tag items -> add "x" to cancel the tag, style the shit out of em.
			- image hover (show username, link to collections?)

		scale for larger amounts of images
			> user avatar upload change to square images
			> 

		INFINITE SCROLL!

		Disappearing navbar!

	smaller items:

		change the masonry implementation on main page to the style on the profile page
		style the collection photo to not squish horizontally!
			> media queries!
			> some way to grab the photo width and set that as the minimum width? 
			> But it needs to be propportional still to the change in the height.




TAG NOTES
	- creation is just put in the title if it doesn't already exist

	- then with photo upload / collection creation send along the array of tags and set those in the controller

	- each form should access the tag store, if tags are made that don't exist yet send another request to create those,
		on completion grab the ids sent back and bundle with the other ajax call?
			> possibly overthinking this.


	-->> send all tags by title, then in the controller for creation/update grab the tags that have or haven't been created and return the ids of them all in the end. 
		-> Tag Model method to look for tags by title then iterate over and create those that have not yet been made.
		

		-> tag store
			- grab all of the tags and house.
			- what needs access to this?
				> tag_form_component
				> search

	









Other Random Notes:
	User
		> add uniqueness validation for email on database side
		> add a required username for users

	Masonry -> copy the strategy used for the profile images! 

	Optimize:
		> figure out way to optimize the display of high resolution phptos. THe feed doesnt need all these full resolution versions of the image!

	Style:
		- when click on search bar placeholder text disappear (even before the user starts typing)

		Nice little menu once users are logged in for navbar
