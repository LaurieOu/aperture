TASKS FOR TOMORROW:

ISSUE:

		BUGS::

			1. easy: comment form placeholder when not signed in : "Please sign in to comment"
			2. medium: clicking on profile link when scrolled down on index page causes it to remain static
			3. medium: comments are not updated when scrolling through photos
			4. hard: edit form not behaving correctly when editing a photo
			5. medium: clicking on a collection sometimes raises a "avatar not defined" error
					> rendering collection photos index items before the photos arrive possible
					> error seems to be with passing in data to collection prematurely somewhere (also only seems to occur if logged in... must be connected to an if that will only progress if there is a current user)
			6. easy: turn all tags to lowercase on the backend

			[X] detail -> search by tag -> homescreen formatting fucks up!
				> react attempts to render only the new photos from the photostore, but this causes masonry to freak the fuck out!
				

		FEATURES::

			Add Edit collection form
			infinite scroll
			Make a splash page

			appropriate seed data -> all user profiles should have a standard pretty photo

			some kind of guiding


			Allow counting of views, collection view page of some kind. (see all collections an image is in)
			guest login fix
				> two guest accounts using at the same time freaks it out
