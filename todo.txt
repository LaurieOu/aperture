UserProfile broken
Finish the flux loop for adding photos to collections.
	-- currently writing the callback action for the collection
	-- need to write collection constants, and collection store(?)


Questions:	
	- many to many relationship, how to handle the creation of new rows/etc. (Blanking super hard here...)
		> do I send through the API, to where? Make multiple calls? Kinda lost... 

		ANSWER: send params IDs and assign them on backend. Rails will handle it, and using associations for controllers will send back correct information.

	- router
		> is the route looking good? any suggestions for how to possibly restructure/etc.
		> entry hook for the router? if I am planning on using the sign in page etc as a modal changes that may be needed?



QUESTION:
	- How to handle redirect upon successful callback of the ajax request for login/upload/etc.
			ANSWER: pass a callback to the ajax call from the handle submit, invoke it in the success callback.
								- multiple images:
									> only invoke the callback if the length === the index passed along (and there is a callback) that 
										way the redirect will only occur when all of the photos have been uploaded.


COLLECTION FUNCTIONS
	- add photos to collections
	
		> from photo detail (for now)
		> adding to a collection means updating the PHOTO with the chosen collection ID

		> click on add to collection should cause the current users collections to appear.
			- they select which collections
			- submit
			- patch sent


			photos can be in many collections
			collections can have many photos
			many to many relationship
			join table!
			damnit.

	- view photos within a collection
	- delete a collection
	- edit a collection











> STYLING
	- remake the photo upload form to something more similar 
		to my wireframe.
	- "modal" the photo detail page
	- actual edit menu should only appear if choose to (and current user owns it)
	- when click on search bar placeholder text disappear (even before the user starts typing)
	
	Nice little menu once users are logged in for navbar

> Collection Notes

		API
			- show: returns the collection including referenced photos, the user, etc.
			- user can add a collectiond
			- be able to add a photo to a collection
			- view collections?

	FRONTEND

		- some pretty tab/something way to view collections or images
		- viewing a collection should look the same as when viewing the photo index, just images are only from collection
			> some header at the top with collection name/sample image/use transparent navbar (future build)
		- photo detail page should have link to collection/accessed through user page as well
			> collection is more the users curated gallery to share
			> search results should display top three collections and then images


Other Random Notes:
	User
		> add uniqueness validation for email on database side
		> add a required username for users

	Photo
		> for handling multiple image upload
			- form needs title/description to apply only to the currently clicked on photo

	Masonry
		> look up media queries to size the images correctly as the page resizes (change the width value of the grid elements to window size/3 up to a certain size, then size/2, then size. Seems to me to be the cleanest way to go about this).
