TAGS
	- photo upload form / collection upload form should support input of tags
	- tag store, constants, etc.

COMMENTS
	- photo detail

		- nested for loop to determine photos inclusion within a collection. (BAD)! Optimize later
		- backend validation for uniqueness within scope of the other id (photo, collection) only want one!

> Collection Notes

		API
			- show: returns the collection including referenced photos, the user, etc.
			- user can add a collectiond
			- be able to add a photo to a collection
			- view collections?

	FRONTEND

		- some pretty tab/something way to view collections or images
		- viewing a collection should look the same as when viewing the photo index, just images are only from collection
			> some header at the top with collection name/sample image/use transparent navbar (future build)
		- photo detail page should have link to collection/accessed through user page as well
			> collection is more the users curated gallery to share
			> search results should display top three collections and then images



Other Random Notes:
	User
		> add uniqueness validation for email on database side
		> add a required username for users

	Photo
		> for handling multiple image upload
			- form needs title/description to apply only to the currently clicked on photo

	Masonry
		> look up media queries to size the images correctly as the page resizes (change the width value of the grid elements to window size/3 up to a certain size, then size/2, then size. Seems to me to be the cleanest way to go about this).

	Optimizie:
		> figure out way to optimize the display of high resolution phptos. THe feed doesnt need all these full resolution versions of the image!

	Style:
		- photo detail:
			> image container max height constrain the image. And then fit full width, center vertically.
		- when click on search bar placeholder text disappear (even before the user starts typing)

		Nice little menu once users are logged in for navbar
