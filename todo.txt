> STYLING
	- remake the photo upload form to something more similar 
		to my wireframe.
	- "modal" the photo detail page
	- actual edit menu should only appear if choose to (and current user owns it)
	- when click on search bar placeholder text disappear (even before the user starts typing)
	
> Collection Notes
	
	BACKEND
		- upon creation of a user automatically create a "Favorites" collection for the user.
		- belongs to a user
		- has many photos
			> photos belong to a collection (not necessarily)
		- title
		- description

		API
			- show: returns the collection including referenced photos, the user, etc.

	FRONTEND

	**make a super basic user profile page to test this.**

		- some pretty tab/something way to view collections or images
		- viewing a collection should look the same as when viewing the photo index, just images are only from collection
			> some header at the top with collection name/sample image/use transparent navbar (future build)
		- photo detail page should have link to collection/accessed through user page as well
			> collection is more the users curated gallery to share
			> search results should display top three collections and then images


Other Random Notes:
	User
		> add uniqueness validation for email on database side
		> add a required username for users
